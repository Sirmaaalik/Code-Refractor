# Code Refactor Starter Code

The task was to make the website look the same but to make sure the code had the right
elements in the index and style coding.

For starters, there were no sections, just a bunch of divs.  There also
was no header or footer.

Within the style sheet, a lot of the code was repeated and spreaded out
so much that it made a long code sheet.  Basically we had to add the right elements
and make the code have the same and better functions then before while
also compressing the style sheet basically.
